The famous science fiction author Isaac Asimov stated "Three Laws of Robotics" rules or laws in his novels. These laws, incorporated into almost all of the positronic robots appearing in his fiction, cannot be bypassed, being intended as a safety feature. The rules are:


	
A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
	
A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
	
A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.


Investigate these three rules and align them with the concepts/opinions mentioned in the Russell, Hauert, Altman, & Veloso (2015) article.
